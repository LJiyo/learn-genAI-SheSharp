    "\n",
    "We can see how easy it is to add data to your AI search by just grabbing some text from a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll create our own basic search function that looks through all the lines of the file and counts up how many keywords appear from a search. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll return the 3 lines of hte file with the most matching kewyords and pass it to the AI to communocate to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Get ready\n",
    "1. Get your code from yesterday and paste it in the box below. Or use the box that is two down that I have preppared for you. \n",
    "    - You'll need to add your own key if you are using the provided code. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Look at the data file we will be using, it's called pet_products.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "3. update the question in your code to something relevant to the date, eg: \"I have a puppy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Below your imports add this contant. This provides a list of \"Stop Words\", things that don't help give useful search results.\n",
    "\n",
